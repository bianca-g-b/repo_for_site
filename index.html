 <li>1942<br>Travels to the US to work with the US Navy, and on bombe construction in Washington. Also works in Bell Labs in speech development.</li><br>

  <li>1948<br>Introduced the LU decomposition method, still used today to solve matrix equations. </li><br>

<li>1950<br>Created the Turing test, which introduced the concept of machines having intelligence, comparable to humans.</li><br>

<li>1952<br>Published 'The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis'.</li><br>

<li>1952<br>Turing is charged with gross indecency for being in a homosexual relationship. To avoid imprisonment, Turing had to undergo chemical treatment, which had terrible effects on him
</li><br>
